### Simple Contacts App
**For learning AngularJS with node.js and Express as backend**


#### Installation

It is assumed that you have already installed node and bower. There are a couple of other components that you will need to install.

You should have a global `.bowerrc` file. Create it if it does not exist, with the following contents.

		{
	    	"directory": "public/lib"
		}

Now open your project folder in the commandline and run the following.

		npm install express
		bower install angular
		bower install bootstrap
